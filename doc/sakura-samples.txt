ls | act                                         # randomly scrambles the lines! Taken from cat/cat ;)
ps | rainbow                                     # colors all lines differently
twice itunes -                                   # lowers volume of iTunes... twice :)
10 echo Bart Simpson likes it DRY                # tells you this 10 times. Very sarcastic script!
seq 100 | 1suN 7                                 # prints every 7th element of the list
zombies                                          # prints processes that show zombies (plus funny options to kill them)
find . -size +300M | xargs mvto /tmp/bigfiles/   # moves big files to that directory
alias gp='never_as_root git pull'                # only if u r not root it runs!
dimmiora                                         # Tells you the time with Riccardo voice in Italian. Brilliant!
