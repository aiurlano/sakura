 Synopsys: This is about my Sakura project, which is a Git repo freely available on github to
  help people like you waste their time on funny scripts :) You can also create your own YAML
  files if you put it in $SAKURADIR/doc/richelp/. For instance you could add your friends you
  invited to a party and keep track of invitations, presences and absences and make stats over
  them then.
