## Synopsis

This is my famous SVN which is becoming opensource!

## Install

Download the repo:

	mkdir -p ~/git
	cd ~/git
	git clone git@github.com/palladius/sakura.git

Then add this line to your `~/.bashrc` to get it sourced:

	if [ -f ~/git/sakura/.bashrc ]; then
	  . ~/git/sakura/.bashrc
	fi 

Note. Any help is appreciated to make this changeable!

### BUGS

- Search engine is still broken (see search addon!)
- Add DONE Ajax button... (add 3 routes to todos: toggle, resolve, unr-esolve )
    
### TODO 

- make it to work in whichever dir it is (atm it requires it to be in ~/git/sakura/

## Credits
